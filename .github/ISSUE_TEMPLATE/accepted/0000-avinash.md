# Before Opening Please...
- [ ] Search for an existing/duplicate RRFC which might be relevant to your RRFC

## Motivation ("The Why")
<!-- Examples
In the current implementation of material-datatable , there is no different action when we select all rows together, which creates problem if I want to select only the filtered rows.-->

### Example
<!-- Examples
If i filter out some rows from the table, with a different action i could able to select only the filtered row of the data table-->

### How
#### Current Behaviour
<!-- Examples
Currently if i click on select all checkbox, all the transactions got selected irrespective of if the current state is filetered/searched or not.-->

#### Desired Behaviour
<!-- Examples
If a different action type can be introduced in rows selection other than the common action (rowsSelected), then it might be greatly helpful ot perform the operations.-->
