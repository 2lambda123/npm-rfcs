### Notes

- **Issue**: [#581 [RRFC] add message (or opt-out support) for non registry tarball URLs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/581)
  - @thescientist13
    - At the last meeting we went over it and it seems ready to turn into a proper RFC
**PR**: [#566 RFC: Command Specific Configuration](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/566)
  - @darcyclarke
    - Need to document all commands and any configuration options that might affect them
- **PR**: [#564 RFC: Dependency Selector Syntax &amp; &#x60;npm query&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/564)
  - @darcyclarke
    - Adressed some of the early feedback concerns, adding a dynamic attribute pseudo selector, e.g: `:attr(:scripts([test~=tap]))`
  - @ljharb
    - Let's chose something else other than the name `Class` for the `.dev`, `.optional`, `.workspace` type of selectors, maybe:
      -  `Dependency Types` ?
      -  `Dependency Classifications` ?
      -  `Dependency Categories` ?
      -  `Dependency Groups` ?
- **Issue**: [#548 [RRFC] Add flag for running NPM commands in transitive dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/548)
  - @ljharb
    - `npm` need to implement a way to determine the topological order in which to run workspaces scripts (or other commands), this order is determined by reading the dependency graph and starting with the leaves
    - potentially two different modes:
      - run in topological order only including specific workspaces
      - run in topological order also including any transitive workspace dependency not specifically determined
    - could add flags to implement those, e.g: `--include-workspace-transitive-deps`
- **Issue**: [#546 [RRFC] Clean up file ownership story](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/546)
  - @ruyadorno 
    - Action item is to write the actual RFC
- **Issue**: [#539 [RRFC] Security: audit lockfiles for injection](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/539)
  - @darcyclarke
    - Going to remove the agenda label, looks like it's already work in progress
- **PR**: [#519 RFC: Package Distributions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519)
  - @darcyclarke
    - Not much in terms of updates
  - @ruyadorno 
    - Might be a good idea to progress with an "expanding optional dependencies support" RFC
- **Issue**: [#479 BREAKING CHANGE(bin): command should not return non-existent paths](https://github.com/npm/statusboard/issues/479)
  - @ruyadorno 
    - from last meeting:
    - (@ljharb) Needs to plan for the potential breakage for users using $(npm bin) in their PATH, possibly point users to a npx replacement
    - (@nlf) `npx` can start supporting the --location flag in order to support some of these usecases
  - @darcyclarke
    - **Action item:**
      - Remove agenda label
      - Backlog the working items
- **Issue**: [#575 [FEATURE] run-script with workspaces should short-circuit on script error](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/575)
  - @ljharb
    - This is another feature/behavior that can benefit from the previously mentioned "topological order"
    - Parallel, parallel short circuiting, topological
  - @darcyclarke
    - Maybe start the work on supporting a `--fail-fast` flag before tweaking order of execution
    - Pipelines, user-defined order of execution for workspaces
  - @ljharb
    - Expanding on the capabilities from topological order with manually tweaking pipelines for custom order sounds like a powerful feature
