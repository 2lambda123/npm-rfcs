### Notes
**Issue**: [#581 [RRFC] add message (or opt-out support) for non registry tarball URLs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/581) - @thescientist13
  - @thescientist13
    - Be able to warn/fail or opt-out when finding dependencies that are not coming from a registry (be it a public or private one), e.g: git deps, direct tarball ref
  - @ljharb
    - In general, when a problem comes from a direct dependency (one that is listed in my `package.json`) `npm` should be strict and let me know about it so that I can fix it but if the problem is coming from a transitive dependency then it's better to be silent by default and opt-in (to warning or other forms of call to action) since I can't directly act on it
  - @fritzy
    - Probably a good idea to add some syntax in `npm query` to select based on type of package (git dep/local folder/direct tarball/registry tarball)
  - @ruyadorno
    - **Action item:**
      - Should be good to go and write a proper RFC

**Issue**: [#548 [RRFC] Add flag for running NPM commands in transitive dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/548) - @zgriesinger
  - @ljharb
    - There's a difference between `npm` being able to figure out the dependency chain and running scripts in the right order vs a complex pipeline approach similar to `wireit`
    - All different approach depends/ relies on `npm` knowledge of the dependency graph

**Issue**: [#546 [RRFC] Clean up file ownership story](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/546) - @ruyadorno
  - @nlf
    - problem specific to root users
    - applies to Unix-only
    - npm tries to fix ownership of files if you're running as root and have unintended consequences such as trying to change ownership of an entire `bin` directory
    - the ideal approach would be to not do that automatically and instead inform users of consequences but we should not be changing ownership of files written by a root user into something else
    - example: docker container, has all commands runs as root by default, has options to not change ownership
    - one option is to add a flag to opt-out of the file ownership "fixing" for root users
    - should remove the entire portion of the code that infers ownership of files
    - We should not be trying to fix operation system problems for users
  - @ljharb
    - could be awesome to have this type of logic that fixes files ownership live within `npm doctor`
  - @ruyadorno 
    - **Action item:**
      - Write an actual RFC

**Issue**: [#539 [RRFC] Security: audit lockfiles for injection](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/539) - @fritzy
  - @fritzy
    - A malicious actor could replace items in the lock file
  - @nlf
    - We recently added logic to make sure the tree is valid when installing from a lockfile
  - @fritzy
    - **Action Item:**
      - Update issue with this update to let users aware

**Issue**: [#479 BREAKING CHANGE(bin): command should not return non-existent paths](https://github.com/npm/statusboard/issues/479) - @lineus
  - @ljharb
    - Needs to plan for the potential breakage for users using `$(npm bin)` in their PATH, possibly point users to a `npx` replacement
  - @nlf
    - `npx` can start supporting the `--location` flag in order to support some of these usecases

**Issue**: [#575 [FEATURE] run-script with workspaces should short-circuit on script error](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/575) - @johndiiorio
  - @fritzy
    - Right now using `npm run --workspaces` will run tests across all configured workspaces even when one of the tests are already broken
  - @ljharb
    - `npm run` should already run in the logical-dependency-order (topological-sorting vs random/alphabetical order)
    - topological order won't likely break any usecases while random order is not capable of supporting many other scenarios
  - @darcyclarke
    - there's a lot of prior art from current tooling on creating pipelines to determine the desired order
  - @ljharb
    - When only considering workspaces there should be no need of a manually defined pipeline since the cli can figure out the order of dependencies
  - @ruyadorno 
    - Should be able to add an option as proposed here to define that behavior of fast failing when having one workspace test failing
  - @ljharb
    - When opting into the topological sorting, failing fast should be the default
  - @darcyclarke
    - could be a good case to make `npm build` a top level command that opt-into topological sorting by default
  - @ljharb
    - other commands can also benefit from topological sorting, start for multiple depending modules, test, etc
  - @darcyclarke
    - Pipelines systems can also fix usecases in which topological sorting alone wouldn't be able to
