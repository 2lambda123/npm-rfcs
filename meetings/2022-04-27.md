### Notes

#### **Issue**: [#572 [RRFC] remove &#x60;--access public&#x60; for initial publish of scoped modules](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/572) - @bnb
- @ljharb
  - would rather see a holistic approach to improving the UX of scoped pkgs, private vs public pkgs, etc
  - first make `npm init` default to `private: true` and then tweak the access values
- @wraithgar
  - historically scoped packages were created hand to hand with private packages but that might not be the case anymore
  - it might make more sense today to tweak the value of these configs
- @darcyclarke
  - `npm init` defaults to `private: true` in npm v9
  - remove `--access public` when publishing a scoped package for the first time

#### **Issue**: [#571 [RRFC] make npm update useful for modern package management](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/571) - @bnb
- @bnb
  - has had issues for years with having to navigate `npm outdated` & `npm update`
  - wants a direct/meaningful path to update dependencies
- @wraithgar
  - you want something that gets `latest` updates?
  - ex. `npm-check-updates`
- @bnb
  - yes.
  - wants a experience closer to `npm outdated` in which you can see the wanted vs latest published version to registry
- @ljharb
  - there should be an interactive update mode: `npm update -i`
  - much simpler for the regular user to use an interactive interface to select what version of a dependency they want to update to
- @ruyadorno 
  - have been actively pushing against because of how many other items we have to address first
  - want a holistic approach to `--interactive` (so there's consistency approach across all the commands)
- @feelepxyz
  - dependabot could delete a lot of code if `npm` add this
  - dependabot introduced different strategies to deal with different changes done by an update to `package.json` (ex. https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#versioning-strategy)

#### **Issue**: [#570 [RRFC] &#x60;workspace-tag-version-prefix&#x60; config](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/570) - @ljharb
- @ljharb
  - proposing a default syntax for handling the tag name, message

#### **PR**: [#550 RFC: Improve signature verification](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/550) - @feelepxyz
- @feelepxyz
  - has addressed all feedback & updatd the RFC
- @darcyclarke
  - we can add this to `install` under a flag once we know performance isn't greatly impacted
