### Notes

#### **PR**: [#595 Propose backwards-compatible improvements to compression](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595) - @EvanHahn
- Sounds like a good idea but we would need a JavaScript implementation (similar to how we have `tar` today) in order to impleement it
- Overall sentiment is that the compression improvement is welcome but it looks like it would take a proof of concept and challenge some of the edge cases to see if there are any unintended consequences, etc

#### **PR**: [#593 Only Registry Tarballs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/593) - @thescientist13
- Needs more clarification:
  - add the flag to `npm audit` instead of `npm install` ?
  - as long as the lock file is available `npm audit` will work as expected.
- `npm install` should have a flag to respect the status of `npm audit`
- `eslint`-like config needs to exist for `npm audit`
  - these configs could/would have three different values (ex. off/warn/fail)
  - current set of audit checks can/would include:
    - peer deps
    - engines
    - vulnerabilities
    - signatures
    - dependency-types
    - licenses
- **Actions:**
  - [ ] @thescientist13 to update RFC based on feedback 

#### **PR**: [#591 RFC: Registry-scoped keyfile / certfile credential options](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/591) - @jenseng
- @wraithgar
  - this was an oversight
  - should have always worked this way

#### **PR**: [#564 RFC: Dependency Selector Syntax &amp; &#x60;npm query&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/564) - @darcyclarke
- @ruyadorno 
  - still a WIP
  - will have more to show next week
