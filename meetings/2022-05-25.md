### Notes

#### **PR**: [#593 Only Registry Tarballs](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/593) - @thescientist13
- @thescientist13
  - Bringing in as an RFC the results of the conversations in the original RRFC issue (https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/581) discussed previously in these meetings
- @ljharb
  - Thinks it's very important to handle five different modes:
    - silent 
    - warn on indirect deps
    - warn on direct deps
    - warn on everything
    - fail on everything
- @darcyclarke
  - Potential in the future for this to be augmented/have more granular control, once `npm query` lands
- @ljharb
  - There's a need for more **npm** commands to be more granular on what packages they act on
- @darcyclarke
  - Better to hold on for now on adding any new way to filter/group packages until we have `npm query` out and see how we can best serve all these scenarios in a more holistic way
  - Stick with 3 modes:
    - warn on any git dep (default)
    - silent (same as today, opt-in)
    - strict / fail on any git dep (opt-in)
- @ljharb
  - Too strong on transitive dep maintainers to then switch to strict mode by default
  - Avoiding maintainer burnout should always be a priority
- @darcyclarke
  - There was a research from @naugtur showing that there's less than 1% of usage of git deps within top 10K packages, [ref](https://github.com/naugtur/research/blob/036ed9c84257c5d22d9952f765b0c95fd0ca5d85/git-deps/gits.md).
  - Sounds like we're blocked on making a decision here until `npm query` is ready.
- @ljharb
  - RFC should be worded to include any remote-dep that is not coming from the registry (local linked deps are ok) but remote tarballs should also be included
  - Should relate the RFC to `npm audit` instead of tie it to `npm install` then it becomes auditing of dependency types (or similar), then install can one day maybe become configurable to failing if audit (or type audit) fails
- @thescientist13
  - Will clean the RFC up and incorporate all the feedback

#### **PR**: [#564 RFC: Dependency Selector Syntax &amp; &#x60;npm query&#x60;](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/564) - @darcyclarke
- @ruyadorno 
  - will demo something next week 

#### **Issue**: [#575 [FEATURE] run-script with workspaces should short-circuit on script error](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/575) - @johndiiorio
- @darcyclarke
  - discussed this at length in other calls
  - have backlogged work items to address this (ie. fail fast flag & topolgoical workspace ordering)
  - removing from the agenda
