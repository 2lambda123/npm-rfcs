#### ℹ️ Updates:

1. **Improving Output:**
    - **Issue**: [#482 [RRFC] npm should use stderr for errors](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/482) - @exx8
    - @lukekarrys wip: streaming log file, progress bar improvements, we can take out of the agenda for now
2. **Respecting returned registry `resolve` fields:**
    - **PR**: [#486 Resolved registry overrides](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/486) - @everett1992
    - **PR**: [#4264 implement options affecting &#x60;resolved&#x60; value in lock files.](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4264) - @everett1992
    - @fritzy `replace registry host` can be either `default` (https://registry.npmjs.org), `always` (replacing with `registry` value) or `avoid` replacing at all. ref: https://github.com/npm/pacote/pull/143
    - @everett1992 an important feature needed is to skip storing the custom registry value back to the lockfile (interesting usecase with rotating registries)
3. **`npm copy`:**
    - **PR**: [#493 docs: add npm copy rfc](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/493) - @everett1992
    - https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/4082
4. **Package Distributions:**
    - **PR**: [#519 RFC: Package Distributions](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519) - @darcyclarke
    - TBD: Schedule a separate call to discuss the proposal
5. **Shared Version Specifications**:
    - **PR**: [#528 RFC: Shared Version Specifications](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/528) - @boginw
    - https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/528#issuecomment-1068424777
    - @darcyclarke a way to work around this is to use `overrides` to tie various semver ranges declared for a given package in the installed graph to a specific version of a package
6. **Improving Workspaces:** 
    - **Issue**: [#556 [RRFC] improving the workspaces symlinking experience](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/556) - @bnb
    - @ruyadorno
      - this has been implemented for `npm version`
      - can now map the same functionality to other commands (like the example, `npm init`) 

#### ⭐️ New Items:

#### 1. **Issue**: [#4236 BREAKING CHANGE(bin): command should not return non-existent paths](https://github.com/npm/statusboard/issues/479) - @lineus
- @ljharb 
  - many people abuse `npm bin`  & have put it in their path
  - should be encouraged to use `npx`
- @darcyclarke
  - this has been added to the `v9` backlog of breaking changes
- @wraithgar
  - should we just deprecate this command? what is the use for it these days?

#### 2. **Issue**: [#3806 [FEATURE] run-script with workspaces should short-circuit on script error](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3806) - @johndiiorio
- @wraithgar 
  - this was discussed previously and was a deliberate decision when we first implemented support to workspaces
- @darcyclarke
  - adding a `--fast-fail` or `--bail` option sounds like a reasonable decision

#### 3. **Issue**: [#539 [RRFC] Security: audit lockfiles for injection](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/539) - @fritzy
- @fritzy 
  - arguments have been made that if someone can modify files in your repo 
- @darcyclarke
  - could shove this check in `npm doctor` 

#### 4. **PR**: [#547 add &quot;obey user specifier&quot; RFC](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/547) - @ljharb
- @ljharb 
  - this came up because of a breakage
  - `npm install =` resolves to `^`
  - `npm` has always behaved this way (ie. drops all prefixes & uses the `save-prefix`)
- @wraithgar 
  - this is a bug

#### 5. **Issue**: [#548 [RRFC] Add flag for running NPM commands in transitive dependencies](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/548) - @zgriesinger
- @zgriesinger
  - currently use lerna for this (topological order for building)
  - respecting dependencies and running 
- @darcyclarke
  - https://turborepo.org/docs/features/pipelines
- @ljharb
  - current tooling do not deviate from the regular dependency graph
- @wraithgar
  - seem weird to have these magic/special relationships when running scripts (ex. `npm test` should not, by default, run the tests of dependants)
- @ruyadorno
  - we've tried this awhile back with `postinstall` scripts for `.reify()`
  - we can probably fix

#### 6. **Issue**: [#549 [RRFC] support different &#x60;--before&#x60; policy per package prefix/pattern](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/549) - @osher

#### 7. **Issue**: [#559 [RRFC] expanding behavior of &#x60;--before&#x60; to support date adjustment and setting via config](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/559) - @MylesBorins
